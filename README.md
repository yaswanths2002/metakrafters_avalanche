### Executing program

To run the programs in this repository we need to use Remix, an online Solidity IDE . We can find it here: https://remix.ethereum.org/ Now we need to create a new file by clicking on the '+' and name the file as you wish with an extension .sol(Ex: challenge4.sol) And now copy the code from this repository in the 'challenge4.sol'

### Compiling the Contract

To compile the code click on the third icon and set the compiler version to the required version and set it to auto compile.

### Deploying the Contract

And after compiling the code sucessfully click on the below icon and deploy your code and we need to change the environment to Injected Provider-Meta Mask and deploy the contract and test the remaining functionalites
